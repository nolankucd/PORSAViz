PORSAViz is a software tool developed for the H2020 PORSAV Project. The data collected by this project consists of gas detection thermal imaging and simultaneous Schliern imaging of gas leaks during laparoscopic surgery. This software provides tools for the identification of these leaks and means to quantify them. 

This software was developed using MATLABâ€™s App Designer and compiled to a standalone desktop app for the Windows Platform.
